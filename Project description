Project: Linear regression model for CCPP power prediction using AWS Sagemaker

The goal of this project was to create a model capable of predicting power generated at a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP), using dataset of 9569 measurement points of ambient parameters. The data consisted of: Atmospheric temperature and pressure, relative humidity and exhaust vacuum. Data was taken from:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant

Tools used in this project were:

Amazon Sagemaker – AWS platform for machine learning
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
Sagemaker is a perfect tool to use in this case. It allows user to work in a Jupyter notebook on a chosen instance without having to download or configure it by hand. Additionally there are multiple algorithms available to the user which simplifies the process of creating a model. The algorithm used in this project was Linear learner.

The code was written in Python 3. The steps in a process were:

loading the dataset (csv file)
splitting it in 3 to training:
training which was used to train a model
validation to test the model during the process of training and adjust the model
test to compare model predictions with the remaining data
uploading files to created S3 bucket
loading the linear learner algorithm
training the model at a ml.c4.xlarge type instance
creating the endpoint of the trained model
testing the model
deleting the endpoint to release the instance
The accuracy of the model was 99.92 %.
